Puppeteer

Puppeteer is a Python program that handles uploading MET characters to the Puppet Prince website. You will provide your username and password. Then just pass it an XML GEX file and it will create new characters with all of the data from the file.

Caveats:

- Skips Virtues and attributes like name and Clan
- Cannot import the notes section
- Cannot import XP as Puppet Prince can't store enough information for this conversion to be valid
